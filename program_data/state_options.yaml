# Data on standard utility allowances is incomplete; I am adding in state data
# as needed rather than trying to add every state at once. Some states have
# more complexity when it comes to standard utility allowances, such as multiple
# regions in one state, and/or different SUA values for different household sizes.
# That complexity is not modeled here yet.
#
# See the standard_utility_allowances folder and associated README for more
# information, context, and parsing scripts.
