# Python API

We are testing out making this prototype available as a Python API.

Since the API is pre-alpha, it is not yet hosted on the Python Package Index (PyPI), but can be downloaded as a dependency via GitHub.

The entrypoint to the API is the `SnapEstimateEntrypoint` class. See:

```
snap_financial_factors/benefit_estimate/snap_estimate_entrypoint.py
```
